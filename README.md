# 2DHODGE
This code simulates a 2-dimensional cellular automaton called "Hodge", I wrote this code in C in 1994 as an exercise for the System's Theory university course in Milan (DSI.UNIMI.IT). I added libraries, prj file, header file .H and images showing the output results. One day I will execute the code on some other platform, I used to compile code with the glorious Borland Turbo C using x86 processors back in the 90s..!
