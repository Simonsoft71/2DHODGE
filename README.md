# 2DHODGE
This code simulates a 2-dimensional cellular automaton called "Hodge", I wrote this code in C in 1994 as an exercise for the System's Theory corse of my university in Milan. I added some header file .H and images showing the output results. One day I will execute the code on some other platform, I used to compile code with the glorious Borland Turbo C using x86 processors from the 90s..!
